When I heard Datastax was doing a 12 days of Codemas challenge, well you KNOW your boy had to take a crack at it. What better way to do that than a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://proto-pulsar-3qmym5m9z-jasonetorres-projects.vercel.app/\">Christmas Cookie Recipe Finder</a>! It’s a web application that allows users to search for cookie recipes. I used Astro (cuz not smart enough for other stuff haha ) for the frontend and Datastax’s own AstraDB as the backend to store and retrieve recipe data. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-but\">BUT…..</h3>\n<p>since This is a Christmas build and I didn’t have much to go on, THIS Santa had to call on his Christmas Elves to pull off this Christmas miracle build. So I phone the homies Ryan Furrer and Chris Nowicki.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-key-features\">Key Features</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><ul>\n<li><ol>\n<li><p><strong>Search Functionality</strong>: Users can search for recipes by entering keywords in the title. This feature is crucial for enhancing user experience, as it allows users to quickly find the recipes they are interested in. The search functionality is implemented using a simple form that captures user input and triggers a search query against the database.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p><strong>Dynamic Results</strong>: The application retrieves and displays matching recipes in real-time. This is achieved by leveraging the power of React's state management and the efficient querying capabilities of DataStax Astra. As users type in the search bar, the application dynamically updates the list of recipes displayed, providing immediate feedback.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>DataStax Astra Integration</strong>: Utilizes the DataStax Astra database to store and query recipe data. The integration with Astra was PRETTY seamless, thanks to its comprehensive API and support for various programming languages, but also thanks to their docs. This allows the application to efficiently store and retrieve large volumes of recipe data, ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"heading-development-process\">Development Process</h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-setting-up-the-environment\">Setting Up the Environment</h3>\n<p>To get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Node.js</strong> (version 14 or higher): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It's essential for setting up the development environment and running the application locally.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>npm</strong> (Node Package Manager): npm is the default package manager for Node.js, used to install and manage dependencies for the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A <strong>DataStax Astra</strong> account with a database set up: DataStax Astra provides a free tier, making it accessible for developers to experiment with and integrate into their applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-running-the-application\">Running the Application</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Clone the Repository</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"> git <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">clone</span> https://github.com/jasonetorres/proto-pulsar.git\n <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">cd</span> recipe-search-app\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"> npm i\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Start the Development Server</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"> npm start\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, in order to run the application, you need to set up environment variables in a <code>.env</code> file:</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-configuring-the-database\">Configuring the Database</h3>\n<p>Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your DataStax Astra connection details:</p>\n<p><code>ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=https://&lt;your-database-endpoint&gt;</code></p>\n<p><code>ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=&lt;your-application-token&gt;</code></p>\n<p>Replace &lt;your-database-endpoint&gt; and &lt;your-application-token&gt; with your actual DataStax Astra credentials, I feel the disclaimer isn’t necessary, but hey ya never know. I am sure we've all done this once haha.

What better way to do that than a [Christmas Cookie Recipe Finder](https://proto-pulsar-3qmym5m9z-jasonetorres-projects.vercel.app/)! It’s a web application that allows users to search for cookie recipes. I used Astro (cuz not smart enough for other stuff haha ) for the frontend and Datastax’s own AstraDB as the backend to store and retrieve recipe data. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.\n\n### BUT…..\n\nsince This is a Christmas build and I didn’t have much to go on, THIS Santa had to call on his Christmas Elves to pull off this Christmas miracle build. So I phone the homies Ryan Furrer and Chris Nowicki.\n\n### Key Features\n\n1. * 1. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for recipes by entering keywords in the title. This feature is crucial for enhancing user experience, as it allows users to quickly find the recipes they are interested in. The search functionality is implemented using a simple form that captures user input and triggers a search query against the database.\n            \n            2. **Dynamic Results**: The application retrieves and displays matching recipes in real-time. This is achieved by leveraging the power of React's state management and the efficient querying capabilities of DataStax Astra. As users type in the search bar, the application dynamically updates the list of recipes displayed, providing immediate feedback.\n                \n            3. **DataStax Astra Integration**: Utilizes the DataStax Astra database to store and query recipe data. The integration with Astra was PRETTY seamless, thanks to its comprehensive API and support for various programming languages, but also thanks to their docs. This allows the application to efficiently store and retrieve large volumes of recipe data, ensuring a smooth user experience.\n                \n\n## Development Process\n\n### Setting Up the Environment\n\nTo get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:\n\n* **Node.js** (version 14 or higher): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It's essential for setting up the development environment and running the application locally.\n    \n* **npm** (Node Package Manager): npm is the default package manager for Node.js, used to install and manage dependencies for the project.\n    \n* A **DataStax Astra** account with a database set up: DataStax Astra provides a free tier, making it accessible for developers to experiment with and integrate into their applications.\n    \n\nClone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\n    \n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/jasonetorres/proto-pulsar.git\n    cd recipe-search-app\n    ```\n    \n2. **Install Dependencies**:\n    \n    ```bash\n    npm i\n    ```\n    \n3. **Start the Development Server**:\n    \n    ```bash\n    npm start\n    ```\n    \n\nAlso, in order to run the application, you need to set up environment variables in a `.env` file:\n\n### Configuring the Database\n\nCreate a .env file in the root of the project and add your DataStax Astra connection details:\n\n`ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=https://<your-database-endpoint>`\n\n`ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=<your-application-token>`\n\nReplace &lt;your-database-endpoint&gt; and &lt;your-application-token&gt; with your actual DataStax Astra credentials, I feel the disclaimer isn’t necessary, but hey ya never know. I am sure we've all done this once haha. This setup ensures that your application can securely connect to the Astra database and perform queries.\n\n### Building the Components\n\n#### SearchBar Component\n\nThe SearchBar component is responsible for capturing user input and triggering the search functionality. It uses React's useState hook to manage the search term state. This component is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple input field and a search button. The handleReset function allows users to clear the search term and reset the search results, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\n```typescript\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function Searchbar({\n  onSubmit,\n  handleReset,\n}: {\n  onSubmit: any;\n  handleReset: any;\n}) {\n  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(\"\");\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"my-10 w-full flex-col\">\n      <div className=\"w-full max-w rounded-lg bg-card p-6 shadow-lg\">\n        <form className=\"flex gap-3\" onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n          <input\n            type=\"text\"\n            name=\"search\"\n            value={searchTerm}\n            onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}\n            placeholder=\"Search recipes...\"\n            className=\"w-full rounded border border-input bg-card px-4 py-2 \n            text-muted-foreground placeholder:text-muted-foreground \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\" />\n          <button\n            type=\"submit\"\n            className=\"rounded bg-primary px-4 py-2 \n            text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\" />\n            Search\n          </button>\n        </form>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"mt-4 w-full max-w\">\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            setSearchTerm(\"\");\n            handleReset();\n          }}\n          className=\"w-full rounded bg-primary px-4 py-2\n             text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\" />\n          Reset Search\n        </button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### RecipeIsland Component\n\n“would ya like to spend christmas…..on recipe islaaaaannnd…….”\n\nThe RecipeIsland component handles the search logic and displays the search results. It filters recipes based on the search term and manages the state of the filtered recipes. This component is crucial for the application's functionality, as it processes user input, queries the database, and updates the UI with the search results. The use of React's state management ensures that the application remains responsive and efficient. This was a big part that Chris contributed as we had hit a roadblock as to how to effectively query the database\n\n```typescript\nimport { useState, type FormEvent } from \"react\";\nimport type { Recipe } from \"../utils/db\";\nimport Searchbar from \"./SearchBar\";\nimport RecipeCard from \"./RecipeCard\";\n\nexport default function RecipeIsland({ recipes }: { recipes: Recipe[] }) {\n  const [filteredRecipes, setFilteredRecipes] = useState<Recipe[]>([]);\n  const [searchPerformed, setSearchPerformed] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const form = e.target as HTMLFormElement;\n    const formData = new FormData(form);\n    const searchTerm = formData.get(\"search\") as string;\n\n    const searchResults = recipes\n      .filter(\n        (recipe) =>\n          recipe.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||\n          recipe.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()),\n      )\n      .reduce((uniqueRecipes: Recipe[], recipe) => {\n        if (!uniqueRecipes.some((r) => r._id === recipe._id)) {\n          uniqueRecipes.push(recipe);\n        }\n        return uniqueRecipes;\n      }, []);\n\n    console.log(searchResults);\n    setFilteredRecipes(searchResults);\n    setSearchPerformed(true);\n  };\n\n  const handleReset = () => {\n    setFilteredRecipes([]);\n    setSearchPerformed(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\">\n      <Searchbar onSubmit={handleSubmit} handleReset={handleReset} />\n      {searchPerformed ? (\n        filteredRecipes.length > 0 ? (\n          <div className=\"space-y-8\" data-recipes-container>\n            {filteredRecipes.map((recipe, index) => (\n              <RecipeCard\n                key={`recipe-${index}-${recipe.title.toLocaleLowerCase()}`}\n                cookTime={recipe.cookTime}\n                description={recipe.description}\n                difficulty={recipe.difficulty}\n                ingredients={recipe.ingredients}\n                instructions={recipe.instructions}\n                prepTime={recipe.prepTime}\n                title={recipe.title}\n                totalTime={recipe.totalTime}\n              />\n            ))}\n          </div>\n        ) : (\n          <div>\n            <p>No recipes found.</p>\n            <button\n              onClick={handleReset}\n              className=\"mt-5 mb-5 p-3 text-white text-center rounded\"\n              style={{ backgroundColor: '#E11D48' }}\n            >\n              Back to Search\n            </button>\n          </div>\n        )\n      ) : null}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### RecipeCard Component\n\nThe RecipeCard component is responsible for displaying individual recipe details. It ensures that all necessary information is presented in a user-friendly format. This component is designed to be visually appealing, with a clean layout that highlights the recipe's title, description, ingredients, and instructions. The use of conditional rendering ensures that the component gracefully handles missing data, providing default messages when necessary.\n\n```typescript\ninterface RecipeCardProps {  \n  cookTime: string;\n  description: string;\n  difficulty: string;\n  ingredients: string[];\n  instructions: string[];\n  prepTime: string;\n  title: string;\n  totalTime: string;\n}\n\nexport default function RecipeCard({cookTime, description, difficulty, \ningredients, instructions, prepTime, title, totalTime}: RecipeCardProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto space-y-[1em] rounded-lg border-border bg-card \n                    p-6 shadow-l\">\n      <h2 style={{ color: '#E11D48', textAlign: 'center'}}>{title || \"Recipe Title\"}</h2>\n      <p style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>{description || \"Recipe description\"}</p>\n      <div className=\"mx-auto w-fit space-y-0 rounded-md border-2 border-dashed \n                    border-primary px-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex justify-center gap-4 py-4 text-center\">\n          <div>\n            <p className=\"text-sm font-bold\">Total Time</p>\n            <p className=\"text-sm\">{totalTime || \"Total Time not found\"}</p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div>\n            <p className=\"text-sm font-bold\">Difficulty</p>\n            <p className=\"text-sm\">{difficulty || \"Difficulty not found\"}</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <p className=\"text-lg font-bold mx-2\">Ingredients:</p>\n      <ul className=\"list-disc mx-4\">\n        {!ingredients || ingredients.length === 0 ? (\n          <li>Ingredients not found</li>\n        ) : (\n          ingredients.map((ingredient: string) => <li>{ingredient}</li>)\n        )}\n      </ul>\n      <p className=\"text-lg font-bold mx-2\">Instructions:</p>\n      <ol className=\"list-decimal mx-4\">\n        {!instructions || instructions.length === 0 ? (\n          <li>Instructions not found</li>\n        ) : (\n          instructions.map((instruction: string) => <li>{instruction}</li>)\n        )}\n      </ol>\n\n      <div className=\"flex justify-center gap-4 py-4 text-center\">\n        <div>\n          <p className=\"text-sm font-bold\">Prep Time</p>\n          <p className=\"text-sm\">{prepTime || \"Prep Time not found\"}</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n          <p className=\"text-sm font-bold\">Cook Time</p>\n          <p className=\"text-sm\">{cookTime || \"Cook Time not found\"}</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <div>\n          <p className=\"text-sm font-bold\">Total Time</p>\n          <p className=\"text-sm\">{totalTime || \"Total Time not found\"}</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Now….\n\nthis is all well and good and you have a pretty efficiently working search operation but how did we even get the Astradb side setup….well friends I got you.\n\n# How to Set Up an Astra DB Database and Use It in Your Project\n\nAstra DB is a serverless database platform optimized for modern workloads like vector-based and generative AI applications.

This allows the application to efficiently store and retrieve large volumes of recipe data, ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"heading-development-process\">Development Process</h2>\n<h3 id=\"heading-setting-up-the-environment\">Setting Up the Environment</h3>\n<p>To get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Node.js</strong> (version 14 or higher): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It's essential for setting up the development environment and running the application locally.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>npm</strong> (Node Package Manager): npm is the default package manager for Node.js, used to install and manage dependencies for the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A <strong>DataStax Astra DB</strong> account with a database set up: DataStax Astra DB provides a free tier, making it accessible for developers to experiment with and integrate into their applications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-running-the-application\">Running the Application</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Clone the Repository</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"> git <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">clone</span> https://github.com/jasonetorres/proto-pulsar.git\n <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">cd</span> recipe-search-app\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"> npm i\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Start the Development Server</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\"> npm start\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, in order to run the application, you need to set up environment variables in a <code>.env</code> file:</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-configuring-the-database\">Configuring the Database</h3>\n<p>Create a .env file in the root of the project and add your DataStax Astra DB connection details:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-bash\">ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=https://&lt;your-database-endpoint&gt;\nASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=&lt;your-application-token&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Replace <code>&lt;your-database-endpoint&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;your-application-token&gt;</code> with your actual DataStax Astra DB credentials, I feel the disclaimer isn’t necessary, but hey ya never know. I am sure we've all done this once haha. This setup ensures that your application can securely connect to the Astra database and perform queries.</p>\n<h3 id=\"heading-building-the-components\">Building the Components</h3>\n<p><strong>SearchBar Component</strong></p>\n<p>The SearchBar component is responsible for capturing user input and triggering the search functionality. It uses React's useState hook to manage the search term state. This component is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple input field and a search button. The handleReset function allows users to clear the search term and reset the search results, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>\n<p>This was originally built as an Astro component, however, Chris had the bright idea to use React instead. This ability to add in other frameworks and libraries as needed for better interactivity is a massive perk of using Astro. So, Chris took Ryan’s frontend code and sprinkled on his magic with React to make it work as well as possible.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-typescript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { useState } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"react\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">Searchbar</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">{\n  onSubmit,\n  handleReset,\n}: {\n  onSubmit: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">any</span>;\n  handleReset: <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">any</span>;\n}</span>) </span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"\"</span>);\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> (\n    &lt;div className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"my-10 w-full flex-col\"</span>&gt;\n      &lt;div className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"w-full max-w rounded-lg bg-card p-6 shadow-lg\"</span>&gt;\n        &lt;form className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"flex gap-3\"</span> onSubmit={onSubmit}&gt;\n          &lt;input\n            <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">type</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"text\"</span>\n            name=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"search\"</span>\n            value={searchTerm}\n            onChange={<span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">e</span>) =&gt;</span> setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}\n            placeholder=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Search recipes...\"</span>\n            className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"w-full rounded border border-input bg-card px-4 py-2 \n            text-muted-foreground placeholder:text-muted-foreground \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\"</span> /&gt;\n          &lt;button\n            <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">type</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"submit\"</span>\n            className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"rounded bg-primary px-4 py-2 \n            text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\"</span> /&gt;\n            Search\n          &lt;/button&gt;\n        &lt;/form&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n      &lt;div className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"mt-4 w-full max-w\"</span>&gt;\n        &lt;button\n          onClick={<span class=\"hljs-function\">() =&gt;</span> {\n            setSearchTerm(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"\"</span>);\n            handleReset();\n          }}\n          className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"w-full rounded bg-primary px-4 py-2\n             text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\"</span> /&gt;\n          Reset Search\n        &lt;/button&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  );\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>RecipeIsland Component</strong></p>\n<p>“would ya like to spend christmas…..on recipe islaaaaannnd…….”</p>\n<p>The RecipeIsland component handles the search logic and displays the search results. It filters recipes based on the search term and manages the state of the filtered recipes. This component is crucial for the application's functionality, as it processes user input, queries the database, and updates the UI with the search results. The use of React's state management ensures that the application remains responsive and efficient. This was a big part that Chris contributed as we had hit a roadblock as to how to effectively query the database.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-typescript\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> { useState, <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">type</span> FormEvent } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"react\"</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">type</span> { Recipe } <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"../utils/db\"</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> Searchbar <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"./SearchBar\"</span>;\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">import</span> RecipeCard <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"./RecipeCard\"</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">RecipeIsland</span>(<span class=\"hljs-params\">{ recipes }: { recipes: Recipe[] }</span>) </span>{\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> [filteredRecipes, setFilteredRecipes] = useState&lt;Recipe[]&gt;([]);\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> [searchPerformed, setSearchPerformed] = useState(<span class=\"hljs-literal\">false</span>);\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> handleSubmit = <span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">e: FormEvent&lt;HTMLFormElement&gt;</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> form = e.target <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> HTMLFormElement;\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> formData = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> FormData(form);\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> searchTerm = formData.get(<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"search\"</span>) <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">as</span> <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">string</span>;\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> searchResults = recipes\n      .filter(\n        <span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">recipe</span>) =&gt;</span>\n          recipe.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||\n          recipe.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()),\n      )\n      .reduce(<span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">uniqueRecipes: Recipe[], recipe</span>) =&gt;</span> {\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> (!uniqueRecipes.some(<span class=\"hljs-function\">(<span class=\"hljs-params\">r</span>) =&gt;</span> r._id === recipe._id)) {\n          uniqueRecipes.push(recipe);\n        }\n        <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> uniqueRecipes;\n      }, []);\n\n    <span class=\"hljs-built_in\">console</span>.log(searchResults);\n    setFilteredRecipes(searchResults);\n    setSearchPerformed(<span class=\"hljs-literal\">true</span>);\n  };\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">const</span> handleReset = <span class=\"hljs-function\">() =&gt;</span> {\n    setFilteredRecipes([]);\n    setSearchPerformed(<span class=\"hljs-literal\">false</span>);\n  };\n\n  <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> (\n    &lt;div className=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\"</span>&gt;\n      &lt;Searchbar onSubmit={handleSubmit} handleReset={handleReset} /&gt;\n      {searchPerformed ?

When I heard DataStax was doing a 12 days of Codemas challenge, well you KNOW your boy had to take a crack at it; however, this time with some help with a couple of friends. What better way to do that than a [Christmas Cookie Recipe Finder](https://proto-pulsar-3qmym5m9z-jasonetorres-projects.vercel.app/)! It’s a web application that allows users to search for cookie recipes. I used Astro and React for the frontend, and DataStax’s own Astra DB as the backend to store and retrieve recipe data. The application is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.\n\n**BUT…..**\n\nsince This is a Christmas build and I didn’t have much to go on, THIS Santa had to call on his Christmas Elves to pull off this Christmas miracle build. So I phone the homies @[Ryan Furrer](@ryandotfurrer) and @[Chris Nowicki](@chrisnowicki).\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Search Functionality**: Users can search for recipes by entering keywords in the searchbar. This feature is crucial for enhancing user experience, as it allows users to quickly find the recipes they are interested in. The search functionality is implemented using a simple form that captures user input and triggers a search query against the database.\n    \n2. **Displaying Results**: The application searches for any recipe titles and descriptions containing the user’s keyword and then displays any matching recipes. This is achieved by leveraging the power of React's state management and the efficient querying capabilities of DataStax’s Astra DB. All users have to do is enter the keyword they’d like to search and submit it; they should near instantly be returned a list of recipes where the keyword is in either the recipe’s title or description.\n    \n3. **DataStax Astra DB Integration**: Utilizes the DataStax Astra DB database to store and query recipe data. The integration with Astra DB was PRETTY seamless, thanks to its comprehensive API and support for various programming languages including TypeScript which we used in this project. This allows the application to efficiently store and retrieve large volumes of recipe data, ensuring a smooth user experience.\n    \n\n## Development Process\n\n### Setting Up the Environment\n\nTo get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:\n\n* **Node.js** (version 14 or higher): Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It's essential for setting up the development environment and running the application locally.\n    \n* **npm** (Node Package Manager): npm is the default package manager for Node.js, used to install and manage dependencies for the project.\n    \n* A **DataStax Astra DB** account with a database set up: DataStax Astra DB provides a free tier, making it accessible for developers to experiment with and integrate into their applications.\n    \n\nClone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:\n\n### Running the Application\n\n1. **Clone the Repository**:\n    \n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/jasonetorres/proto-pulsar.git\n    cd recipe-search-app\n    ```\n    \n2. **Install Dependencies**:\n    \n    ```bash\n    npm i\n    ```\n    \n3. **Start the Development Server**:\n    \n    ```bash\n    npm start\n    ```\n    \n\nAlso, in order to run the application, you need to set up environment variables in a `.env` file:\n\n### Configuring the Database\n\nCreate a .env file in the root of the project and add your DataStax Astra DB connection details:\n\n```bash\nASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT=https://<your-database-endpoint>\nASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=<your-application-token>\n```\n\nReplace `<your-database-endpoint>` and `<your-application-token>` with your actual DataStax Astra DB credentials, I feel the disclaimer isn’t necessary, but hey ya never know. I am sure we've all done this once haha. This setup ensures that your application can securely connect to the Astra database and perform queries.\n\n### Building the Components\n\n**SearchBar Component**\n\nThe SearchBar component is responsible for capturing user input and triggering the search functionality. It uses React's useState hook to manage the search term state. This component is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple input field and a search button. The handleReset function allows users to clear the search term and reset the search results, enhancing the overall user experience.\n\nThis was originally built as an Astro component, however, Chris had the bright idea to use React instead. This ability to add in other frameworks and libraries as needed for better interactivity is a massive perk of using Astro. So, Chris took Ryan’s frontend code and sprinkled on his magic with React to make it work as well as possible.\n\n```typescript\nimport { useState } from \"react\";\n\nexport default function Searchbar({\n  onSubmit,\n  handleReset,\n}: {\n  onSubmit: any;\n  handleReset: any;\n}) {\n  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState(\"\");\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"my-10 w-full flex-col\">\n      <div className=\"w-full max-w rounded-lg bg-card p-6 shadow-lg\">\n        <form className=\"flex gap-3\" onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n          <input\n            type=\"text\"\n            name=\"search\"\n            value={searchTerm}\n            onChange={(e) => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}\n            placeholder=\"Search recipes...\"\n            className=\"w-full rounded border border-input bg-card px-4 py-2 \n            text-muted-foreground placeholder:text-muted-foreground \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\" />\n          <button\n            type=\"submit\"\n            className=\"rounded bg-primary px-4 py-2 \n            text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\" />\n            Search\n          </button>\n        </form>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"mt-4 w-full max-w\">\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            setSearchTerm(\"\");\n            handleReset();\n          }}\n          className=\"w-full rounded bg-primary px-4 py-2\n             text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90 \n            focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-ring\" />\n          Reset Search\n        </button>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**RecipeIsland Component**\n\n“would ya like to spend christmas…..on recipe islaaaaannnd…….”\n\nThe RecipeIsland component handles the search logic and displays the search results. It filters recipes based on the search term and manages the state of the filtered recipes. This component is crucial for the application's functionality, as it processes user input, queries the database, and updates the UI with the search results. The use of React's state management ensures that the application remains responsive and efficient. This was a big part that Chris contributed as we had hit a roadblock as to how to effectively query the database.\n\n```typescript\nimport { useState, type FormEvent } from \"react\";\nimport type { Recipe } from \"../utils/db\";\nimport Searchbar from \"./SearchBar\";\nimport RecipeCard from \"./RecipeCard\";\n\nexport default function RecipeIsland({ recipes }: { recipes: Recipe[] }) {\n  const [filteredRecipes, setFilteredRecipes] = useState<Recipe[]>([]);\n  const [searchPerformed, setSearchPerformed] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = (e: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    const form = e.target as HTMLFormElement;\n    const formData = new FormData(form);\n    const searchTerm = formData.get(\"search\") as string;\n\n    const searchResults = recipes\n      .filter(\n        (recipe) =>\n          recipe.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) ||\n          recipe.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()),\n      )\n      .reduce((uniqueRecipes: Recipe[], recipe) => {\n        if (!uniqueRecipes.some((r) => r._id === recipe._id)) {\n          uniqueRecipes.push(recipe);\n        }\n        return uniqueRecipes;\n      }, []);\n\n    console.log(searchResults);\n    setFilteredRecipes(searchResults);\n    setSearchPerformed(true);\n  };\n\n  const handleReset = () => {\n    setFilteredRecipes([]);\n    setSearchPerformed(false);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\">\n      <Searchbar onSubmit={handleSubmit} handleReset={handleReset} />\n      {searchPerformed ? (\n        filteredRecipes.length > 0 ? (\n          <div className=\"space-y-8\" data-recipes-container>\n            {filteredRecipes.map((recipe, index) => (\n              <RecipeCard\n                key={`recipe-${index}-${recipe.title.toLocaleLowerCase()}`}\n                cookTime={recipe.cookTime}\n                description={recipe.description}\n                difficulty={recipe.difficulty}\n                ingredients={recipe.ingredients}\n                instructions={recipe.instructions}\n                prepTime={recipe.prepTime}\n                title={recipe.title}\n                totalTime={recipe.totalTime}\n              />\n            ))}\n          </div>\n        ) : (\n          <div>\n            <p>No recipes found.</p>\n            <button\n              onClick={handleReset}\n              className=\"mt-5 mb-5 p-3 text-white text-center rounded\"\n              style={{ backgroundColor: '#E11D48' }}\n            >\n              Back to Search\n            </button>\n          </div>\n        )\n      ) : null}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**RecipeCard Component**\n\nThe RecipeCard component is responsible for displaying individual recipe details. It ensures that all necessary information is presented in a user-friendly format. This component is designed to be visually appealing, with a clean layout that highlights the recipe's title, description, ingredients, and instructions. The use of conditional rendering ensures that the component gracefully handles missing data, providing default messages when necessary.\n\n```typescript\ninterface RecipeCardProps {  \n  cookTime: string;\n  description: string;\n  difficulty: string;\n  ingredients: string[];\n  instructions: string[];\n  prepTime: string;\n  title: string;\n  totalTime: string;\n}\n\nexport default function RecipeCard({cookTime, description, difficulty, \ningredients, instructions, prepTime, title, totalTime}: RecipeCardProps) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto space-y-[1em] rounded-lg border-border bg-card \n                    p-6 shadow-l\">\n      <h2 style={{ color: '#E11D48', textAlign: 'center'}}>{title || \"Recipe Title\"}</h2>\n      <p style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>{description || \"Recipe description\"}</p>\n      <div className=\"mx-auto w-fit space-y-0 rounded-md border-2 border-dashed \n                    border-primary px-4\">\n        <div className=\"flex justify-center gap-4 py-4 text-center\">\n          <div>\n            <p className=\"text-sm font-bold\">Total Time</p>\n            <p className=\"text-sm\">{totalTime || \"Total Time not found\"}</p>\n          </div>\n\n          <div>\n            <p className=\"text-sm font-bold\">Difficulty</p>\n            <p className=\"text-sm\">{difficulty || \"Difficulty not found\"}</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <p className=\"text-lg font-bold mx-2\">Ingredients:</p>\n      <ul className=\"list-disc mx-4\">\n        {!ingredients || ingredients.length === 0 ?

Key accomplishments include:\n\n* Clean architecture with separate components for search, results display, and recipe cards\n    \n* Efficient database integration with Astra DB for recipe storage and retrieval\n    \n* Responsive UI with thoughtful features like search reset and \"no results\" handling\n    \n* Comprehensive documentation covering setup, configuration, and database integration\n    \n\nThis Christmas cookie recipe finder that makes hunting down holiday treats super easy! Built it using Astro with a splash of React (keeping it simple!) and DataStax Astra DB for storing all those delicious recipes.\n\nThe collaboration between myself and Ryan Furrer and Chris Nowicki REALLLLLLY helped overcome technical challenges, particularly with database querying and styling. The project serves as a practical example of building a full-stack application with modern web technologies while maintaining good development practices through proper component separation, error handling, and thorough documentation.\n\nGo ahead and give it a try! There's a sample database of around 20 recipes already loaded up. Down the line, I'm thinking we might spice things up with some Langflow to throw in some AI-generated recipes. Perfect for when you're craving something sweet but not sure what to bake! 🍪\n\nLet me know if you try it out - would love to hear what kinds of cookies you end up making! And hey, if you've got any killer cookie recipes to add to the database, send 'em my way!","coverImage":"https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1733929738583/76fa249c-5f08-4da0-b05f-eb07cebe881f.png","brief":"Co-authored by Jason Torres, Ryan Furrer, and Chris Nowicki.\nOverview\nHEY HEY and happy holidays yall.

Advanced AI tools like [Pieces for Developers](https://pieces.app/), [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot?ef_id=_k_CjwKCAjwpbi4BhByEiwAMC8JnTiBS3mvNrZG3SO1BwV9UoYMZGgDWoCPCFhG3VB2qmgCWsN7jxZ3ChoCkBEQAvD_BwE_k_&OCID=AIDcmmb150vbv1_SEM__k_CjwKCAjwpbi4BhByEiwAMC8JnTiBS3mvNrZG3SO1BwV9UoYMZGgDWoCPCFhG3VB2qmgCWsN7jxZ3ChoCkBEQAvD_BwE_k_&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwpbi4BhByEiwAMC8JnTiBS3mvNrZG3SO1BwV9UoYMZGgDWoCPCFhG3VB2qmgCWsN7jxZ3ChoCkBEQAvD_BwE), or [CursorAI](https://www.cursor.com/), use machine learning to further enhance productivity by generating complex code snippets tailored to specific project requirements, ensuring consistency across the codebase.\n\n#### Accelerating Development\n\nThe automation of repetitive tasks and the use of code generation tools collectively speed up the development process, particularly benefiting agile environments where quick iteration and deployment are crucial. For instance, AI-driven code linters and formatters can automatically ensure that code adheres to predefined style guides, reducing the need for manual corrections and reviews.\n\n#### AI as a Learning Tool\n\nAI also serves as a powerful educational resource, providing instant feedback and acting as a virtual mentor, especially for junior developers. This immediate feedback loop accelerates learning, fostering a deeper understanding of coding principles and techniques. By acting as both a guide and a tutor, AI empowers developers to refine their skills continuously, ensuring they remain competitive and proficient in an ever-evolving technological landscape.\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1728942191386/3b006f89-f2c2-4804-a6d4-2a2c2985c1fb.png align=\"center\")\n\n### The Bad:\n\n#### Potential Skill Degradation - Quality vs. Quantity\n\nDespite the productivity gains, there is a growing concern about the potential erosion of coding skills due to over use of AI tools. This reliance might lead to a decline in essential problem-solving and algorithmic thinking abilities. Striking a balance is crucial to ensure core skills are preserved.\n\nAlso while AI tools can increase code output, this may sometimes come at the expense of code quality. AI-generated code might lack the nuanced understanding and best practices a human developer would apply. Maintaining rigorous code review processes and adhering to coding standards is essential to uphold code quality.\n\n#### Creativity and Innovation\n\nAI's tendency to suggest conventional solutions could potentially stifle creative problem-solving and limit the exploration of novel approaches. Developers might find themselves adhering to AI's suggestions, which are typically based on existing patterns and data, rather than venturing into uncharted territories that could lead to groundbreaking innovations. By leveraging AI to generate ideas and provide insights, developers can use it as a starting point to spark their creativity. AI can offer a diverse range of possibilities that developers can build upon, allowing them to explore new directions and refine their ideas.\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1728942203333/2005024a-5cba-449d-81e2-640fc6aadc5f.png align=\"center\")\n\n### `T`he Ugly:\n\n#### Ethical and Security Concerns\n\nAI-generated code introduces unique ethical and security challenges. Clear guidelines and oversight are necessary to address potential security vulnerabilities and ethical questions about accountability and transparency. AI decision-making in software development raises ethical questions about accountability and transparency. If an AI system makes a decision that leads to a negative outcome, it can be difficult to determine who is responsible,the developer, the AI, or the organization using the AI. Developers and organizations must implement robust measures to mitigate these risks, such as conducting thorough audits of AI outputs and ensuring diverse and representative training data.\n\n#### Balancing AI and Human Input\n\nTo effectively integrate AI into the development process without losing the human touch, it's important to use AI as a supportive tool that enhances human capabilities rather than replacing them. By automating repetitive tasks, AI allows developers to concentrate on more creative and strategic work. It can also offer insights and suggestions that developers can refine, combining AI's efficiency with human creativity. Human oversight is essential to uphold quality and ethical standards, involving developers in decision-making to interpret AI data and make informed choices. But how you ask, well one way is regular audits of AI outputs help identify biases or errors, ensuring alignment with organizational goals and values. Balancing AI and human input enables organizations to fully leverage AI's potential while maintaining the crucial human elements of innovation and ethical responsibility.\n\n#### The Future of Development Roles\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into software development, developers' roles are evolving. Routine coding tasks are increasingly handled by AI, allowing developers to focus on complex problem-solving and strategic planning. To work effectively with AI, developers must learn new skills like machine learning and data analysis. Additionally, new job roles are emerging, such as AI tool specialists and AI ethics officers, to manage AI systems and address ethical concerns. Professionals who can align AI technology with business goals are also in demand. This shift drives home the point that you need to be continuously learning and adapting in the ever-changing development landscape.\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1728942223004/8699e84f-2756-45ca-b111-ab45c6a6f4b6.png align=\"center\")\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAI in software development is FOR SURE a double-edged sword. It offers significant productivity enhancements but also poses risks to fundamental development skills. Striking a balance, using AI as an augmentation to human input, is super important. As the field evolves, developers and organizations must weigh the benefits and challenges of AI, considering its massive impact on the future of software engineering.

You can do this by using your project's API key or a user's session ID.\n    \n* Send a Message:\n    \n    * Use the Appwrite SDK or API to call the messaging service and send a message.\n        \n        ```javascript\n        const sdk = require('node-appwrite');\n        \n        // Init SDK\n        const client = new sdk.Client();\n        \n        const messaging = new sdk.Messaging(client);\n        \n        client\n            .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1') // Your API Endpoint\n            .setProject('<PROJECT_ID>') // Your project ID\n            .setKey('<API_KEY>') // Your secret API key\n        ;\n        \n        // update provider\n        messaging.updateSendgridProvider(\n            '<PROVIDER_ID>',\n            '<PROVIDER_NAME>',\n            '<API_KEY>',\n            '<DOMAIN>',\n            '<IS_EU_REGION?>',\n            '<SENDER_NAME>',\n            '<SENDER_EMAIL>',\n            '<REPLY_TO_NAME>',\n            '<REPLY_TO_EMAIL>',\n            '<ENABLED?>',\n        ).then(function (response) {\n            console.log(response);\n        }, function (error) {\n            console.log(error);\n        });\n        \n        // delete provider\n        messaging.deleteProvider('<PROVIDER_ID>')\n        .then(function (response) {\n            console.log(response);\n        }, function (error) {\n            console.log(error);\n        });\n        ```\n        \n    * Specify the recipient's email address, the sender's email address (usually your verified Mailgun domain), the message subject, and the message body. In Appwrite Messaging, each user has **targets** like their email, phone number, and devices with your app installed. You can deliver messages to users through their **targets**. If the user signed up with email and password, their account would already have email as a target. During development, you can add targets to existing accounts by navigating to **Authentication** &gt; **Users** &gt; **Select a user** &gt; **Targets** &gt; **Add a subscriber**.\n        \n        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712397233215/e71bcf3a-91e1-416a-9c73-dc9f1a9fcaff.png align=\"center\")\n        \n    * You can also implement forms in your app to collect contact information and add it as a target with the createTarget endpoint\n        \n\nYou can also create topics programmatically using an [Appwrite Server SDK.](https://appwrite.io/docs/references/cloud/server-nodejs/messaging#createTopic)\n\n```javascript\nconst sdk = require('node-appwrite');\n\n// Init SDK\nconst client = new sdk.Client();\n\nconst messaging = new sdk.Messaging(client);\n\nclient\n    .setEndpoint('https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1') // Your API Endpoint\n    .setProject('5df5acd0d48c2')                 // Your project ID\n    .setKey('919c2d18fb5d4...a2ae413da83346ad2') // Your secret API key\n;\n\nconst topic = await messaging.createTopic(\n        '[TOPIC_ID]',                            // topicId\n        '[NAME]'                                 // name\n    );\n```\n\nAppwrite will handle the message sending process using Mailgun's API under the hood.\n\n---\n\n* Handle Response: Check the response from the Appwrite API to ensure that the message was sent successfully. Appwrite will provide a response indicating the status of the message delivery.\n    \n* Monitor Message Status (Optional): You can also monitor the status of your messages using Mailgun's dashboard or API. This allows you to track delivery status, bounces, and other important metrics related to your messages.\n    \n    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1712397798092/1455b025-20c0-46f4-bd65-bdb332109dc0.png align=\"center\")\n    \n\n---\n\nAnd that's it!
